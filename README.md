# M4Labs

<h1>Welcome to #M4Labs project!</h1>

***Can we establish the potential of the links between education, science and open data movements related in this case to methodologies?***

First thanks a lot for your interest. Yes, you are reading, visiting the Methodologies for Labs project! 
This document (the Readme file) is a space to give you some information about the general project, the goal and steps to achieve it. Jump straight to one of the sections below, or just scroll down to find out more.
You are invited to participate, sharing your ideas and data. 
For these, you can read Contributing.md, CodeofConduct.md 

<h1>What is #M4Labs? (And why?)<h1>

Is an iniciative interested on methodologies - as open practice -  used by Labs and collaborative spaces. 

<h2>What is a lab?</h2>
I know , there are many models, typologies, cases of “laboratories” . For #M4labs just want to consider this  first approach : is a innovation space where are used collaboratives and open practices, methodologies and  methods to propose, share, prototype ideas, products, processes  to achieve the goal of solve ( but also research, think, experiment) problems related to the complex global context. There are ones from  humanitarian, citizen, academics, gov fields. 
<h2>What is a methodology?</h2>
How we do that. A philosophy, paradigm. The steps by steps explanation of the process regarding a particular method(1).

*Examples*: the most popular methodology/phases used are: Empathize,Define,Ideate , Prototype, Test (from Design-Thinking). We can sum the recent  People-Led Innovation Methodology -Define, Ideate, Experiment, Expand-. So, we will  see diverse activities, tools incorporate to the labs spaces. These scattered  products/resources used by each steps  will be our research objects.

1-Note:  we can find some literature related to labs where methodology is the same or is used like method. 
<h2>What is the problem?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dispersed experiences. Lack of a common space for reunite the products/activities related to this type of methodologies.</li>
  
<li>These activities/steps of the methodologies used by labs or collaboratives spaces several times  remain  “invisibles”.</li>

<li>Lack of interest on the role and the real impact of the “methodologies”  to the openness/democratization on the labs contexts.</li>

</ul>

<h2>What is the solution?</h2>
<ul>
<li>A lots of the steps (from methodologies/methods processes) used for labs are distributed as digital resources - video, papers, images, photos,tweets- across the all Web.  We need reunite its on a unique space to democratize the knowledge, practice and help the reproducibility issue. We can do it thinking about a  Methodologies Expedition to search ones. </li>
<li>I think ones of the benefits of reunite on a digital platform ( second phase of #M4Labs) the different cases - as  open educational resources - of methodologies used by labs can help to put in evidence the linked practices within open movements.</li>
  </ul>
  
<h1>How can #M4labs help fix the gaps?</h1>
As a first step towards achieving that objective we search the visible findings. The resources used on the process such as canvas templates, images, photos, documents, videos. I called this first task:** Methodologies Expedition ** (a remix of the School of Data methodology ). Here you can see the Guidelines and Spreadsheet.(SOON!) 
Locate useful  dimensions to understand the current “ state of the art” of lab methodologies. For that I will use two open surveys as a complementary tool for track info.
Future Steps/Goals: Intervews,Digital Repository, Taxonomy,   Workshops about OER´s for lab methodologies and more. Create an OPEN CANVAS .  Your ideas!
Soon the Roadmap! 

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
Virginia Brussa from Argentina. Internationalist. Working close to innovation and collaborative spaces, labs, research. Very interested about how open practices could help to matching agendas , policies and skills between the academia, gov and civil society arenas. Advocacy for data, science, open education  actions.
